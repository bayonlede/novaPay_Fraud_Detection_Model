The primary intention is to showcase how supervised classification models, combined with advanced resampling techniques and explainability tools, can effectively identify fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced datasets (<1% fraud prevalence).\n","\n","Key objectives include:\n","- **Supervised Classification**: Building robust models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to distinguish fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.\n","- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Applying SMOTE, class weighting, and ensemble methods to improve recall without sacrificing precision.\n","- **Explainability Integration**: Using SHAP values to provide transaction-level transparency for analysts and regulators.\n","- **Deployment Readiness**: Packaging the solution as a FastAPI microservice with Docker for real-time scoring in production.\n","- **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Implementing drift detection with Evidently and establishing retraining playbooks for evolving fraud patterns.\n","\n","The overarching goal is to deliver a **15% improvement in fraud detection recall** compared to rules-based baselines, while maintaining user trust, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency. This notebook serves as both a technical blueprint and a stakeholder-facing artifact, ensuring clarity, reproducibility, and alignment with NovaPay’s mission to provide secure, affordable, and lightning-fast digital financial services.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":78,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1534,"status":"ok","timestamp":1765887738405,"user":{"displayName":"Bayonle

Here’s why:\n","\n","- **Uniqueness**: Each IP address is a unique identifier tied to a specific device or session. There is no logical \"average\" or \"default\" IP that can replace a missing one.  \n","- **Non-redundancy**: IPs do not follow a distribution that allows statistical imputation (e.g., mean, median, mode). Filling them in would introduce fabricated identifiers.  \n","- **Integrity**: Artificially inserting values could compromise downstream tasks such as fraud detection, geolocation, or user tracking.  \n","- **Traceability**: Since IP addresses are critical for audit trails, any imputation would reduce the reliability of the dataset.  \n","\n","👉 Therefore, the most robust approach is to **drop records with missing `ip_address` values**, ensuring that only verifiable and complete identifiers remain in the dataset.\n","\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":90,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":15,"status":"ok","timestamp":1765887739297,"user":{"displayName":"Bayonle Dauda","userId":"12476046718145428764"},"user_tz":0},"id":"UCOyUNUSrxtH","outputId":"ded7c434-569b-489b-9497-0bd861dbce3c"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","Index: 11095 entries, 0 to 11399\n","Data columns (total 26 columns):\n"," #   Column                     Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------                     --------------  -----  \n"," 0   transaction_id             11095 non-null  object \n"," 1   customer_id                11095 non-null  object \n"," 2   timestamp                  11066 non-null  object \n"," 3   home_country               11095 non-null  object \n"," 4   source_currency            11095 non-null  object \n"," 5   dest_currency              11095 non-null  object \n"," 6   channel                    11095 non-null  object \n"," 7   amount_src                 11095 non-null  float64\n"," 8   amount_usd                 11095 non-null  float64\n"," 9   fee                        11095 non-null  float64\n"," 10  exchange_rate_src_to_dest  11095 non-null  float64\n"," 11  device_id                  11095 non-null  object \n"," 12  new_device                 11095 non-null  bool   \n"," 13  ip_address                 11095 non-null  object \n"," 14  ip_country                 11095 non-null  object \n"," 15  location_mismatch          11095 non-null  bool   \n"," 16  ip_risk_score              11095 non-null  float64\n"," 17  kyc_tier                   11095 non-null  object \n"," 18  account_age_days           11095 non-null  int64  \n"," 19  device_trust_score         11095 non-null  float64\n"," 20  chargeback_history_count   11095 non-null  int64  \n"," 21  risk_score_internal        11095 non-null  float64\n"," 22  txn_velocity_1h            11095 non-null  int64  \n"," 23  txn_velocity_24h           11095 non-null  int64  \n"," 24  corridor_risk              11095 non-null  float64\n"," 25  is_fraud                   11095 non-null  bool   \n","dtypes: bool(3), float64(8), int64(4), object(11)\n","memory usage: 2.1+ MB\n"]}],"source":["master_df.info()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eOVDaqqQTwjT"},"source":["Removing records with missing `ip_address` entries also resolves the majority of missing values present in other columns.
